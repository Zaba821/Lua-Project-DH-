# Lua-Project-DH-

Description: One of my for fun projects I had worked on for over the past year. DH (Darkest Hour) was a game that was more or less experimenting with coding and attempting to create new systems with an API I was less familiar with.

- Used core programming logic on an unfamiliar language to code and as well as construct a menu GUI and game services (teleportation in this instance)

- Used Enums, instances, and many variables and enigne beta features to code a system that would trigger events and sounds (In this case artillery). This script would also take into consideration the distance a user would be from the exact point of where the sound would play and a "part (Object)" event would trigger (an explosion). Experimented with many other possibilities such as implementing a footstep system where a the sound of the step would change depending on the "material" the user steps on.

- Planning to take a few of these scripts and to modularlise it with classes and structures to be able to be be used when needed by the user (whenever and wherever) with the least amount of lines as possible.
